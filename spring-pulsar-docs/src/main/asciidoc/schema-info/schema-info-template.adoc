== Specifying Schema Information
If you use Java primitive types, the framework auto-detects the schema for you, and you need not specify any schema types for publishing the data.
For non-primitive types, if the Schema is not explicitly specified when invoking send operations on the `{template-class}`, the Spring for Apache Pulsar framework will try to build a `Schema.JSON` from the type.

IMPORTANT: Complex Schema types that are currently supported are JSON, AVRO, PROTOBUF, and KEY_VALUE w/ INLINE encoding.

=== Custom Schema Mapping
As an alternative to specifying the schema when invoking send operations on the `{template-class}` for complex types, the schema resolver can be configured with mappings for the types.
This removes the need to specify the schema as the framework consults the resolver using the outgoing message type.

With this configuration in place, there is no need to set specify the schema on send operations.
