== Specifying Schema Information

As indicated earlier, for Java primitives, the Spring for Apache Pulsar framework can infer the proper Schema to use on the `{listener-class}`.
For non-primitive types, if the Schema is not explicitly specified on the annotation, the Spring for Apache Pulsar framework will try to build a `Schema.JSON` from the type.

IMPORTANT: Complex Schema types that are currently supported are JSON, AVRO, PROTOBUF, and KEY_VALUE w/ INLINE encoding.

=== Custom Schema Mapping
As an alternative to specifying the schema on the `{listener-class}` for complex types, the schema resolver can be configured with mappings for the types.
This removes the need to set the schema on the listener as the framework consults the resolver using the incoming message type.

With this configuration in place, there is no need to set the schema on the listener, for example:

include::{listener-class}/listener-snippet.adoc[]
