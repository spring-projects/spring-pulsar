By default, Pulsar clients communicate with Pulsar services in plain text.
The following section describes how to configure Pulsar clients to use TLS encryption (SSL).
A pre-requisite is that the Broker has also been configured to use TLS encryption.

The Spring Boot auto-configuration does not currently support any TLS/SSL configuration properties.
You can instead provide a `PulsarClientBuilderCustomizer` that sets the necessary properties on the Pulsar client builder.
Pulsar supports both Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) and Java KeyStore (JKS) certificate formats.

Follow these steps to configure TLS:

1. Adjust the Pulsar client service url to use the `pulsar+ssl://` scheme and TLS port (typically `6651`).
2. Adjust the admin client service url to use the `https://` scheme and TLS web port (typically `8443`).
3. Provide client builder customizer(s) that sets the relevant properties on the builder.
