[[pulsar-client]]
== Pulsar Client

When you use the Pulsar Spring Boot Starter, you get the `PulsarClient` auto-configured.

By default, the application tries to connect to a local Pulsar instance at `pulsar://localhost:6650`.
This can be adjusted by setting the `spring.pulsar.client.service-url` property to a different value.

TIP: The value must be a valid {apache-pulsar-docs}/client-libraries-java/#connection-urls[Pulsar Protocol] URL

There are many application properties available to configure the client.
See the <<application-properties.adoc#appendix.application-properties.pulsar-client,Appendix>> for more detail.

== Message Production

[[pulsar-producer]]
=== Pulsar Template

On the Pulsar producer side, Spring Boot auto-configuration provides a `PulsarTemplate` for publishing records. The template implements an interface called `PulsarOperations` and provides methods to publish records through its contract.

There are two categories of these send API methods: `send` and `sendAsync`.
The `send` methods block calls by using the synchronous sending capabilities on the Pulsar producer.
They return the `MessageId` of the message that was published once the message is persisted on the broker.
The `sendAsync` method calls are asynchronous calls that are non-blocking.
They return a `CompletableFuture`, which you can use to asynchronously receive the message ID once the messages are published.

NOTE: For the API variants that do not include a topic parameter, a <<topic-resolution.adoc#appendix.topic-resolution,topic resolution process>> is used to determine the destination topic.

==== Simple API
The template provides a handful of methods ({javadocs}/org/springframework/pulsar/core/PulsarOperations.html[prefixed with _'send'_]) for simple send requests. For more complicated send requests, a fluent API lets you configure more options.

==== Fluent API
The template provides a {javadocs}/org/springframework/pulsar/core/PulsarOperations.html#newMessage(T)[fluent builder] to handle more complicated send requests.

==== Message customization
You can specify a `TypedMessageBuilderCustomizer` to configure the outgoing message. For example, the following code shows how to send a keyed message:
====
[source, java]
----
template.newMessage(msg)
    .withMessageCustomizer((mb) -> mb.key("foo-msg-key"))
    .send();
----
====

==== Producer customization
You can specify a `ProducerBuilderCustomizer` to configure the underlying Pulsar producer builder that ultimately constructs the producer used to send the outgoing message.

WARNING: Use with caution as this gives full access to the producer builder and invoking some of its methods (such as `create`) may have unintended side effects.

For example, the following code shows how to disable batching and enable chunking:
====
[source, java]
----
template.newMessage(msg)
    .withProducerCustomizer((pb) -> pb.enableChunking(true).enableBatching(false))
    .send();
----
====

This other example shows how to use custom routing when publishing records to partitioned topics.
Specify your custom `MessageRouter` implementation on the `Producer` builder such as:
====
[source, java]
----
template.newMessage(msg)
    .withProducerCustomizer((pb) -> pb.messageRouter(messageRouter))
    .send();
----
====

TIP: Note that, when using a `MessageRouter`, the only valid setting for `spring.pulsar.producer.message-routing-mode` is `custom`.

This other example shows how to add a `ProducerInterceptor` that will intercept and mutate messages received by the producer before being published to the brokers:
====
[source, java]
----
template.newMessage(msg)
    .withProducerCustomizer((pb) -> pb.intercept(interceptor))
    .send();
----
====

:template-class: PulsarTemplate
include::schema-info/schema-info-template.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

[[pulsar-producer-factory]]
=== Pulsar Producer Factory
The `PulsarTemplate` relies on a `PulsarProducerFactory` to actually create the underlying producer. Spring Boot auto-configuration also provides this producer factory. Additionally, you can configure the factory by specifying any of the available producer-centric application properties.
See the <<application-properties.adoc#appendix.application-properties.pulsar-producer,Appendix>>.

NOTE: If topic information is not specified when using the producer factory APIs directly, the same <<topic-resolution.adoc#appendix.topic-resolution,topic resolution process>> used by the `PulsarTemplate` is used with the one exception that the "Message type default" step is **omitted**.

[[producer-caching]]
==== Pulsar Producer Caching
Each underlying Pulsar producer consumes resources. To improve performance and avoid continual creation of producers, the producer factory caches the producers that it creates. They are cached in an LRU fashion and evicted when they have not been used within a configured time period. The link:{github}/blob/8e33ac0b122bc0e75df299919c956cacabcc9809/spring-pulsar/src/main/java/org/springframework/pulsar/core/CachingPulsarProducerFactory.java#L159[cache key] is composed of just enough information to ensure that callers are returned the same producer on subsequent creation requests.

Additionally, you can configure the cache settings by specifying any of the `spring.pulsar.producer.cache` prefixed application properties.
See the <<application-properties.adoc#appendix.application-properties.pulsar-producer,Appendix>>.

=== Intercept Messages on the Producer
Adding a `ProducerInterceptor`  lets you intercept and mutate messages received by the producer before they are published to the brokers.
To do so, you can pass a list of interceptors into the `PulsarTemplate` constructor.
When using multiple interceptors, the order they are applied in is the order in which they appear in the list.

If you use Spring Boot auto-configuration, you can specify the interceptors as Beans.
They are passed automatically to the `PulsarTemplate`.
Ordering of the interceptors is achieved by using the `@Order` annotation as follows:

====
[source, java]
----
@Bean
@Order(100)
ProducerInterceptor firstInterceptor() {
  ...
}

@Bean
@Order(200)
ProducerInterceptor secondInterceptor() {
  ...
}
----
====

== Message Consumption

[[pulsar-listener]]
=== Pulsar Listener

When it comes to Pulsar consumers, we recommend that end-user applications use the `PulsarListener` annotation.
To use `PulsarListener`, you need to use the `@EnablePulsar` annotation.
When you use Spring Boot support, it automatically enables this annotation and configures all the components necessary for `PulsarListener`, such as the message listener infrastructure (which is responsible for creating the Pulsar consumer).
`PulsarMessageListenerContainer` uses a `PulsarConsumerFactory` to create and manage the Pulsar consumer.

This consumer factory is also auto-configured through Spring Boot.
See the <<application-properties.adoc#appendix.application-properties.pulsar-consumer,Appendix>> for Pulsar consumer properties.

Let us revisit the `PulsarListener` code snippet we saw in the quick-tour section:

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "hello-pulsar-subscription", topics = "hello-pulsar")
public void listen(String message) {
    System.out.println("Message Received: " + message);
}
----
====

You can further simplify this method:

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener
public void listen(String message) {
    System.out.println("Message Received: " + message);
}
----
====

In this most basic form, you must provide the following two properties with their corresponding values:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
spring.pulsar.consumer:
  topics: hello-pulsar
  subscription-name: hello-pulsar-subscription
----

NOTE: If the topic information is not directly provided, a <<topic-resolution.adoc#appendix.topic-resolution,topic resolution process>> is used to determine the destination topic.


In the `PulsarListener` method shown earlier, we receive the data as `String`, but we do not specify any schema types.
Internally, the framework relies on Pulsar's schema mechanism to convert the data to the required type.
The framework detects that you expect the `String` type and then infers the schema type based on that information.
Then it provides that schema to the consumer.
For all the primitive types in Java, the framework does this inference.
For any complex types (such as JSON, AVRO, and others), the framework cannot do this inference and the user needs to provide the schema type on the annotation using the `schemaType` property.

The following example shows another `PulsarListener` method, which takes an `Integer`:

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "my-subscription-1", topics = "my-topic-1")
public void listen(Integer message) {
   System.out.println(message);
}
----
====

The following `PulsarListener` method shows how we can consume complex types from a topic:

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "my-subscription-2", topics = "my-topic-2", schemaType = SchemaType.JSON)
public void listen(Foo message) {
    System.out.println(message);
}
----
====

Note the addition of a `schemaType` property on `PulsarListener`.
That is because the library is not capable of inferring the schema type from the provided type: `Foo`. We must tell the framework what schema to use.

Let us look at a few more ways.

You can consume the Pulsar message directly:

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "my-subscription", topics = "my-topic")
public void listen(org.apache.pulsar.client.api.Message<String> message) {
    System.out.println(message.getValue());
}
----
====

The following example consumes the record by using the Spring messaging envelope:

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "my-subscription", topics = "my-topic")
public void listen(org.springframework.messaging.Message<String> message) {
    System.out.println(message.getPayload());
}
----
====

Now let us see how we can consume records in batches.
The following example uses `PulsarListener` to consume records in batches as POJOs:

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "hello-batch-subscription", topics = "hello-batch", schemaType = SchemaType.JSON, batch = true)
public void listen(List<Foo> messages) {
    System.out.println("records received :" + messages.size());
    messages.forEach((message) -> System.out.println("record : " + message));
}
----
====

Note that, in this example, we receive the records as a collection (`List`) of objects.
In addition, to enable batch consumption at the `PulsarListener` level, you need to set the `batch` property on the annotation to `true`.

Based on the actual type that the `List` holds, the framework tries to infer the schema to use.
If the `List` contains a complex type, you still need to provide the `schemaType` on `PulsarListener`.

The following uses the `Message` envelope provided by the Pulsar Java client:

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "hello-batch-subscription", topics = "hello-batch", schemaType = SchemaType.JSON, batch = true)
public void listen(List<Message<Foo>> messages) {
    System.out.println("records received :" + messages.size());
    messages.forEach((message) -> System.out.println("record : " + message.getValue()));
}
----
====

The following example consumes batch records with an envelope of the Spring messaging `Message` type:

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "hello-batch-subscription", topics = "hello-batch", schemaType = SchemaType.JSON, batch = true)
public void listen(List<org.springframework.messaging.Message<Foo>> messages) {
    System.out.println("records received :" + messages.size());
    messages.forEach((message) -> System.out.println("record : " + message.getPayload()));
}
----
====

Finally, you can also use the `Messages` holder object from Pulsar for the batch listener:

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "hello-batch-subscription", topics = "hello-batch", schemaType = SchemaType.JSON, batch = true)
public void listen(org.apache.pulsar.client.api.Messages<Foo>> messages) {
    System.out.println("records received :" + messages.size());
    messages.forEach((message) -> System.out.println("record : " + message.getValue()));
}
----
====

When you use `PulsarListener`, you can provide Pulsar consumer properties directly on the annotation itself.
This is convenient if you do not want to use the Boot configuration properties mentioned earlier or have multiple `PulsarListener` methods.

The following example uses Pulsar consumer properties directly on `PulsarListener`:

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(properties = { "subscriptionName=subscription-1", "topicNames=foo-1", "receiverQueueSize=5000" })
void listen(String message) {
}
----
====

TIP: The properties used are direct Pulsar consumer properties, not the `spring.pulsar.consumer` application configuration properties

:listener-class: PulsarListener
include::schema-info/schema-info-listener.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

=== Accessing the Pulsar Consumer Object
Sometimes, you need direct access to the Pulsar Consumer object.
The following example shows how to get it:

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "hello-pulsar-subscription", topics = "hello-pulsar")
public void listen(String message, org.apache.pulsar.client.api.Consumer<String> consumer) {
    System.out.println("Message Received: " + message);
    ConsumerStats stats = consumer.getStats();
    ...
}
----
====

CAUTION: When accessing the `Consumer` object this way, do NOT invoke any operations that would change the Consumer's cursor position by invoking any receive methods.
All such operations must be done by the container.

[[pulsar-message-listener-container]]
=== Pulsar Message Listener Container

Now that we saw the basic interactions on the consumer side through `PulsarListener`. Let us now dive into the inner workings of how `PulsarListener` interacts with the underlying Pulsar consumer.
Keep in mind that, for end-user applications, in most scenarios, we recommend using the `PulsarListener` annotation directly for consuming from a Pulsar topic when using Spring for Apache Pulsar, as that model covers a broad set of application use cases.
However, it is important to understand how `PulsarListener` works internally. This section goes through those details.

As briefly mentioned earlier, the message listener container is at the heart of message consumption when you use Spring for Apache Pulsar.
`PulsarListener` uses the message listener container infrastructure behind the scenes to create and manage the Pulsar consumer.
Spring for Apache Pulsar provides the contract for this message listener container through `PulsarMessageListenerContainer`.
The default implementation for this message listener container is provided through `DefaultPulsarMessageListenerContainer`.
As its name indicates, `PulsarMessageListenerContainer` contains the message listener.
The container creates the Pulsar consumer and then runs a separate thread to receive and handle the data.
The data is handled by the provided message listener implementation.

The message listener container consumes the data in batch by using the consumer's `batchReceive` method.
Once data is received, it is handed over to the selected message listener implementation.

The following message listener types are available when you use Spring for Apache Pulsar.

* link:{github}/blob/8e33ac0b122bc0e75df299919c956cacabcc9809/spring-pulsar/src/main/java/org/springframework/pulsar/listener/PulsarRecordMessageListener.java#L29[PulsarRecordMessageListener]

* link:{github}/blob/ade2c74482d8ac1407ffe4840fa058475c07bcfc/spring-pulsar/src/main/java/org/springframework/pulsar/listener/PulsarAcknowledgingMessageListener.java#L28[PulsarAcknowledgingMessageListener]

* link:{github}/blob/ade2c74482d8ac1407ffe4840fa058475c07bcfc/spring-pulsar/src/main/java/org/springframework/pulsar/listener/PulsarBatchMessageListener.java#L36[PulsarBatchMessageListener]

* link:{github}/blob/ade2c74482d8ac1407ffe4840fa058475c07bcfc/spring-pulsar/src/main/java/org/springframework/pulsar/listener/PulsarBatchAcknowledgingMessageListener.java#L28[PulsarBatchAcknowledgingMessageListener]

We see the details about these various message listeners in the following sections.

Before doing so, however, let us take a closer look at the container itself.

==== DefaultPulsarMessageListenerContainer

This is a single consumer-based message listener container.
The following listing shows its constructor:

====
[source, java]
----
public DefaultPulsarMessageListenerContainer(PulsarConsumerFactory<? super T> pulsarConsumerFactory,
			PulsarContainerProperties pulsarContainerProperties)
}
----
====

It receives a `PulsarConsumerFactory` (which it uses to create the consumer) and a `PulsarContainerProperties` object (which contains information about the container properties).
`PulsarContainerProperties` has the following constructors:

====
[source, java]
----
public PulsarContainerProperties(String... topics)

public PulsarContainerProperties(Pattern topicPattern)
----
====

You can provide the topic information through `PulsarContainerProperties` or as a consumer property that is provided to the consumer factory.
The following example uses the `DefaultPulsarMessageListenerContainer`:

====
[source, java]
----
Map<String, Object> config = new HashMap<>();
config.put("topics", "my-topic");
PulsarConsumerFactory<String> pulsarConsumerFactorY = DefaultPulsarConsumerFactory<>(pulsarClient, config);

PulsarContainerProperties pulsarContainerProperties = new PulsarContainerProperties();

pulsarContainerProperties.setMessageListener((PulsarRecordMessageListener<?>) (consumer, msg) -> {
		});

DefaultPulsarMessageListenerContainer<String> pulsarListenerContainer = new DefaultPulsarMessageListenerContainer(pulsarConsumerFacotyr,
        pulsarContainerProperties);

return pulsarListenerContainer;
----
====

NOTE: If topic information is not specified when using the listener containers directly, the same <<topic-resolution.adoc#appendix.topic-resolution,topic resolution process>> used by the `PulsarListener` is used with the one exception that the "Message type default" step is **omitted**.

`DefaultPulsarMessageListenerContainer` creates only a single consumer.
If you want to have multiple consumers managed through multiple threads, you need to use `ConcurrentPulsarMessageListenerContainer`.

==== ConcurrentPulsarMessageListenerContainer

`ConcurrentPulsarMessageListenerContainer` has the following constructor:

====
[source, java]
----
public ConcurrentPulsarMessageListenerContainer(PulsarConsumerFactory<? super T> pulsarConsumerFactory,
    PulsarContainerProperties pulsarContainerProperties)
----
====

`ConcurrentPulsarMessageListenerContainer` lets you specify a `concurrency` property through a setter.
Concurrency of more than `1` is allowed only on non-exclusive subscriptions (`failover`, `shared`, and `key-shared`).
You can only have the default `1` for concurrency when you have an exclusive subscription mode.

The following example enables `concurrency` through the `PulsarListener` annotation for a `failover` subscription.

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(topics = "my-topic", subscriptionName = "subscription-1",
				subscriptionType = SubscriptionType.Failover, concurrency = "3")
void listen(String message, Consumer<String> consumer) {
    ...
    System.out.println("Current Thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    System.out.println("Current Consumer: " + consumer.getConsumerName());
}
----
====

In the preceding listener, it is assumed that the topic `my-topic` has three partitions.
If it is a non-partitioned topic, having concurrency set to `3` does nothing. You get two idle consumers in addition to the main active one.
If the topic has more than three partitions, messages are load-balanced across the consumers that the container creates.
If you run this `PulsarListener`, you see that messages from different partitions are consumed through different consumers, as implied by the thread name and consumer names printouts in the preceding example.

NOTE: When you use the `Failover` subscription this way on partitioned topics, Pulsar guarantees message ordering.

The following listing shows another example of `PulsarListener`, but with `Shared` subscription and `concurrency` enabled.

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(topics = "my-topic", subscriptionName = "subscription-1",
				subscriptionType = SubscriptionType.Shared, concurrency = "5")
void listen(String message) {
    ...
}
----
====

In the preceding example, the `PulsarListener` creates five different consumers (this time, we assume that the topic has five partitions).

NOTE: In this version, there is no message ordering, as `Shared` subscriptions do not guarantee any message ordering in Pulsar.

If you need message ordering and still want a shared subscription types, you need to use the `Key_Shared` subscription type.

==== Message Consumption

Let us take a look at how the message listener container enables both single-record and batch-based message consumption.

[discrete]
==== Single Record Consumption
Let us revisit our basic `PulsarListener` for the sake of this discussion:

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "hello-pulsar-subscription", topics = "hello-pulsar")
public void listen(String message) {
    System.out.println("Message Received: " + message);
}
----
====

With this `PulsarListener` method, we essential ask Spring for Apache Pulsar to invoke the listener method with a single record each time.
We mentioned that the message listener container consumes the data in batches using the `batchReceive` method on the consumer.
The framework detects that the `PulsarListener`, in this case, receives a single record. This means that, on each invocation of the method, it needs a singe record.
Although the records are consumed by the message listener container in batches, it iterates through the received batch and invokes the listener method through an adapter for `PulsarRecordMessageListener`.
As you can see in the previous section, `PulsarRecordMessageListener` extends from the `MessageListener` provided by the Pulsar Java client, and it supports the basic `received` method.

[discrete]
==== Batch Consumption
The following example shows the `PulsarListener` consuming records in batches:

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "hello-batch-subscription", topics = "hello-batch", schemaType = SchemaType.JSON, batch = true)
public void listen4(List<Foo> messages) {
    System.out.println("records received :" + messages.size());
    messages.forEach((message) -> System.out.println("record : " + message));
}
----
====

When you use this type of `PulsarListener`, the framework detects that you are in batch mode.
Since it already received the data in batches by using the Consumer's `batchReceive` method, it hands off the entire batch to the listener method through an adapter for `PulsarBatchMessageListener`.

[[pulsar-headers]]
=== Pulsar Headers
The Pulsar message metadata can be consumed as Spring message headers.
The list of available headers can be found in https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-pulsar/blob/main/spring-pulsar/src/main/java/org/springframework/pulsar/support/PulsarHeaders.java[PulsarHeaders.java].

==== Accessing in Single Record based Consumer

The following example shows how you can access the various Pulsar Headers in an application that uses the single record mode of consuming:

====
[source,java]
----
@PulsarListener(topics = "simpleListenerWithHeaders")
void simpleListenerWithHeaders(String data, @Header(PulsarHeaders.MESSAGE_ID) MessageId messageId,
                @Header(PulsarHeaders.RAW_DATA) byte[] rawData,
                @Header("foo") String foo) {

}
----
====

In the preceding example, we access the values for the `messageId` and `rawData` message metadata as well as a custom message property named `foo`.
The Spring `@Header` annotation is used for each header field.

You can also use Pulsar's `Message` as the envelope to carry the payload.
When doing so, the user can directly call the corresponding methods on the Pulsar message for retrieving the metadata.
However, as a convenience, you can also retrieve it by using the `Header` annotation.
Note that you can also use the Spring messaging `Message` envelope to carry the payload and then retrieve the Pulsar headers by using `@Header`.

==== Accessing in Batch Record based Consumer

In this section, we see how to access the various Pulsar Headers in an application that uses a batch consumer:

====
[source,java]
----
@PulsarListener(topics = "simpleBatchListenerWithHeaders", batch = true)
void simpleBatchListenerWithHeaders(List<String> data,
					@Header(PulsarHeaders.MESSAGE_ID) List<MessageId> messageIds,
					@Header(PulsarHeaders.TOPIC_NAME) List<String> topicNames, @Header("foo") List<String> fooValues) {

}
----
====

In the preceding example, we consume the data as a `List<String>`.
When extracting the various headers, we do so as a `List<>` as well.
Spring Pulsar ensures that the headers list corresponds to the data list.

You can also extract headers in the same manner when you use the batch listener and receive payloads as `List<org.apache.pulsar.client.api.Message<?>`, `org.apache.pulsar.client.api.Messages<?>`, or `org.springframework.messaging.Messsge<?>`.

=== Message Acknowledgment

When you use Spring for Apache Pulsar, the message acknowledgment is handled by the framework, unless opted out by the application.
In this section, we go through the details of how the framework takes care of message acknowledgment.

[[message-ack-modes]]
==== Message ACK modes

Spring for Apache Pulsar provides the following modes for acknowledging messages:

* `BATCH`
* `RECORD`
* `MANUAL`

`BATCH` acknowledgment mode is the default, but you can change it on the message listener container.
In the following sections, we see how acknowledgment works when you use both single and batch versions of `PulsarListener` and how they translate to the backing message listener container (and, ultimately, to the Pulsar consumer).

==== Automatic Message Ack in Single Record Mode

Let us revisit our basic single message based `PulsarListener`:

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "hello-pulsar-subscription", topics = "hello-pulsar")
public void listen(String message) {
    System.out.println("Message Received: " + message);
}
----
====

It is natural to wonder, how acknowledgment works when you use `PulsarListener`, especially if you are familiar with using Pulsar consumer directly.
The answer comes down to the message listener container, as that is the central place in Spring for Apache Pulsar that coordinates all the consumer related activities.

Assuming you are not overriding the default behavior, this is what happens behind the scenes when you use the preceding `PulsarListener`:

. First, the listener container receives messages as batches from the Pulsar consumer.
. The received messages are handed down to `PulsarListener` one message at a time.
. When all the records are handed down to the listener method and successfully processed, the container acknowledges all the messages from the original batch.

This is the normal flow. If any records from the original batch throw an exception, Spring for Apache Pulsar track those records separately.
When all the records from the batch are processed, Spring for Apache Pulsar acknowledges all the successful messages and negatively acknowledges (nack) all the failed messages.
In other words, when consuming single records by using `PulsarRecordMessageListener` and the default ack mode of `BATCH` is used, the framework waits for all the records received from the `batchReceive` call to process successfully and then calls the `acknowledge` method on the Pulsar consumer.
If any particular record throws an exception when invoking the handler method, Spring for Apache Pulsar tracks those records and separately calls `negativeAcknowledge` on those records after the entire batch is processed.

If the application wants the acknowledgment or negative acknowledgment to occur per record, the `RECORD` ack mode can be enabled.
In that case, after handling each record, the message is acknowledged if no error and negatively acknowledged if there was an error.
The following example enables `RECORD` ack mode on the Pulsar listener:

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "hello-pulsar-subscription", topics = "hello-pulsar", ackMode = AckMode.RECORD)
public void listen(String message) {
    System.out.println("Message Received: " + message);
}
----
====

You can also set the listener property, `spring.pulsar.listner.ack-mode`, to set the ack mode application-wide.
When doing this, you need not set this on the `PulsarListener` annotation.
In that case, all the `PulsarListener` methods in the application acquire that property.

==== Manual Message Ack in Single Record Mode

You might not always want the framework to send acknowledgments but, rather, do that directly from the application itself.
Spring for Apache Pulsar provides a couple of ways to enable manual message acknowledgments. The following example shows one of them:

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "hello-pulsar-subscription", topics = "hello-pulsar", ackMode = AckMode.MANUAL)
public void listen(Message<String> message, Acknowledgment acknowledgment) {
    System.out.println("Message Received: " + message.getValue());
	acknowledgment.acknowledge();
}
----
====

A few things merit explanation here. First, we enablE manual ack mode by setting `ackMode` on `PulsarListener`.
When enabling manual ack mode, Spring for Apache Pulsar lets the application inject an `Acknowledgment` object.
The framework achieves this by selecting a compatible message listener container: `PulsarAcknowledgingMessageListener` for single record based consumption, which gives you access to an `Acknowledgment` object.

The `Acknowledgment` object provides the following API methods:

====
[source, java]
----
void acknowledge();

void acknowledge(MessageId messageId);

void acknowledge(List<MessageId> messageIds);

void nack();

void nack(MessageId messageId);
----
====

You can inject this `Acknowledgment` object into your `PulsarListener` while using `MANUAL` ack mode and then call one of the corresponding methods.

In the preceding `PulsarListener` example, we call a parameter-less `acknowledge` method.
This is because the framework knows which `Message` it is currently operating under.
When calling `acknowledge()`, you need not receive the payload with the `Message` enveloper` but, rather, use the target type -- `String`, in this example.
You can also call a different variant of `acknowledge` by providing the message ID: `acknowledge.acknowledge(message.getMessageId());`
When you use `acknowledge(messageId)`, you must receive the payload by using the `Message<?>` envelope.

Similar to what is possible for acknowledging, the `Acknowledgment` API also provides options for negatively acknowledging.
See the nack methods shown earlier.

You can also call `acknowledge` directly on the Pulsar consumer:

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "hello-pulsar-subscription", topics = "hello-pulsar", ackMode = AckMode.MANUAL)
public void listen(Message<String> message, Consumer<String> consumer) {
    System.out.println("Message Received: " + message.getValue());
	try {
		consumer.acknowledge(message);
	}
	catch (Exception e) {
		....
	}
}
----
====

When calling `acknowledge` directly on the underlying consumer, you need to do error handling by yourself.
Using the `Acknowledgment` does not require that, as the framework can do that for you.
Therefore, you should use the `Acknowledgment` object approach when using manual acknowledgment.

IMPORTANT: When using manual acknowledgment, it is important to understand that the framework completely stays from any acknowledgment at all.
Hence, it is extremely important to think through the right acknowledgment strategies when designing applications.

==== Automatic Message Ack in Batch Consumption

When you consume records in batches (see "`<<message-ack-modes>>`") and you use the default ack mode of `BATCH` is used, when the entire batch is processed successfully, the entire batch is acknowledged.
If any records throw an exception, the entire batch is negatively acknowledged.
Note that this may not be the same batch that was batched on the producer side. Rather, this is the batch that returned from calling `batchReceive` on the consumer

Consider the following batch listener:

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "hello-pulsar-subscription", topics = "hello-pulsar", batch = true)
public void batchListen(List<Foo> messages) {
    for (Foo foo : messages) {
		...
    }
}
----
====

When all the messages in the incoming collection (`messages` in this example) are processed, the framework acknowledges all of them.

When consuming in batch mode, `RECORD` is not an allowed ack mode.
This might cause an issue, as an application may not want the entire batch to be re-delivered again.
In such situations, you need to use the `MANUAL` acknowledgement mode.

==== Manual Message Ack in Batch Consumption

As seen in the previous section, when `MANUAL` ack mode is set on the message listener container, the framework does not do any acknowledgment, positive or negative.
It is entirely up to the application to take care of such concerns.
When `MANUAL` ack mode is set, Spring for Apache Pulsar selects a compatible message listener container: `PulsarBatchAcknowledgingMessageListener` for batch consumption, which gives you access to an `Acknowledgment` object.
The following are the methods available in the `Acknowledgment` API:

====
[source, java]
----
void acknowledge();

void acknowledge(MessageId messageId);

void acknowledge(List<MessageId> messageIds);

void nack();

void nack(MessageId messageId);
----
====

You can inject this `Acknowledgment` object into your `PulsarListener` while using `MANUAL` ack mode.
The following listing shows a basic example for a batch based listener:

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "hello-pulsar-subscription", topics = "hello-pulsar")
public void listen(List<Message<String>> messgaes, Acknowlegement acknowledgment) {
    for (Message<String> message : messages) {
		try {
			...
	        acknowledgment.acknowledge(message.getMessageId());
		}
		catch (Exception e) {
			acknowledgment.nack(message.getMessageId());
		}
    }
}
----
====

When you use a batch listener, the message listener container cannot know which record it is currently operating upon.
Therefore, to manually acknowledge, you need to use one of the overloaded `acknowledge` method that takes a `MessageId` or a `List<MessageId>`.
You can also negatively acknowledge with the `MessageId` for the batch listener.

=== Message Redelivery and Error Handling

Now that we have seen both `PulsarListener` and the message listener container infrastructure and its various functions, let us now try to understand message redelivery and error handling.
Apache Pulsar provides various native strategies for message redelivery and error handling. We take a look at them and see how we can use them through Spring for Apache Pulsar.

==== Specifying Acknowledgment Timeout for Message Redelivery

By default, Pulsar consumers does not redeliver messages unless the consumer crashes, but you can change this behavior by setting an ack timeout on the Pulsar consumer.
When you use Spring for Apache Pulsar, you can enable this property by setting the `spring.pulsar.consumer.ack-timeout` Boot property.
If this property has a value above zero and if the Pulsar consumer does not acknowledge a message within that timeout period, the message is redelivered.

You can also specify this property directly as a Pulsar consumer property on the `PulsarListener` itself:

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "subscription-1", topics = "topic-1"
                properties = {"ackTimeout=60s"})
public void listen(String s) {
    ...
}
----
====

When you specify `ackTimeout` (as seen in the preceding `PulsarListener` method), if the consumer does not send an acknowledgement within 60 seconds, the message is redelivered by Pulsar to the consumer.

If you want to specify some advanced backoff options for ack timeout with different delays, you can do the following:

====
[source, java]
----
@EnablePulsar
@Configuration
class AckTimeoutRedeliveryConfig {

    @PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "withAckTimeoutRedeliveryBackoffSubscription",
            topics = "withAckTimeoutRedeliveryBackoff-test-topic",
            ackTimeoutRedeliveryBackoff = "ackTimeoutRedeliveryBackoff",
            properties = { "ackTimeout=60s" })
    void listen(String msg) {
        // some long-running process that may cause an ack timeout
    }

    @Bean
    RedeliveryBackoff ackTimeoutRedeliveryBackoff() {
        return MultiplierRedeliveryBackoff.builder().minDelayMs(1000).maxDelayMs(10 * 1000).multiplier(2)
                .build();
    }

}
----
====

In the preceding example, we specify a bean for Pulsar's `RedeliveryBackoff` with a minimum delay of 1 second, a maximum delay of 10 seconds, and a backoff multiplier of 2.
After the initial ack timeout occurs, the message redeliveries are controlled through this backoff bean.
We provide the backoff bean to the `PulsarListener` annotation by setting the `ackTimeoutRedeliveryBackoff` property to the actual bean name -- `ackTimeoutRedeliveryBackoff`, in this case.

==== Specifying Negative Acknowledgment Redelivery

When acknowledging negatively, Pulsar consumer lets you specify how the application wants the message to be re-delivered.
The default is to redeliver the message in one minute, but you can change it by setting `spring.pulsar.consumer.negative-ack-redelivery-delay`.
You can also set it as a consumer property directly on `PulsarListener`, as follows:

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "subscription-1", topics = "topic-1"
                properties = {"negativeAckRedeliveryDelay=10ms"})
public void listen(String s) {
    ...
}
----
====

You can also specify different delays and backoff mechanisms with a multiplier by providing a `RedeliveryBackoff` bean and providing the bean name as the `negativeAckRedeliveryBackoff` property on the PulsarProducer, as follows:

====
[source, java]
----
@EnablePulsar
@Configuration
class NegativeAckRedeliveryConfig {

    @PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "withNegRedeliveryBackoffSubscription",
            topics = "withNegRedeliveryBackoff-test-topic", negativeAckRedeliveryBackoff = "redeliveryBackoff",
            subscriptionType = SubscriptionType.Shared)
    void listen(String msg) {
        throw new RuntimeException("fail " + msg);
    }

    @Bean
    RedeliveryBackoff redeliveryBackoff() {
        return MultiplierRedeliveryBackoff.builder().minDelayMs(1000).maxDelayMs(10 * 1000).multiplier(2)
                .build();
    }

}
----
====

==== Using Dead Letter Topic from Apache Pulsar for Message Redelivery and Error Handling

Apache Pulsar lets applications use a dead letter topic on consumers with a `Shared` subscription type.
For the `Exclusive` and `Failover` subscription types, this feature is not available.
The basic idea is that, if a message is retried a certain number of times (maybe due to an ack timeout or nack redelivery), once the number of retries are exhausted, the message can be sent to a special topic called the dead letter queue (DLQ).
Let us see some details around this feature in action by inspecting some code snippets:

====
[source, java]
----
@EnablePulsar
@Configuration
class DeadLetterPolicyConfig {

    @PulsarListener(id = "deadLetterPolicyListener", subscriptionName = "deadLetterPolicySubscription",
            topics = "topic-with-dlp", deadLetterPolicy = "deadLetterPolicy",
            subscriptionType = SubscriptionType.Shared, properties = { "ackTimeout=1s" })
    void listen(String msg) {
        throw new RuntimeException("fail " + msg);
    }

    @PulsarListener(id = "dlqListener", topics = "my-dlq-topic")
    void listenDlq(String msg) {
        System.out.println("From DLQ: " + msg);
    }

    @Bean
    DeadLetterPolicy deadLetterPolicy() {
        return DeadLetterPolicy.builder().maxRedeliverCount(10).deadLetterTopic("my-dlq-topic").build();
    }

}
----
====

First, we have a special bean for `DeadLetterPolicy`, and it is named as `deadLetterPolicy` (it can be any name as you wish).
This bean specifies a number of things, such as the max delivery (10, in this case) and the name of the dead letter topic -- `my-dlq-topic`, in this case.
If you do not specify a DLQ topic name, it defaults to `<topicname>-<subscriptionname>-DLQ` in Pulsar.
Next, we provide this bean name to `PulsarListener` by setting the `deadLetterPolicy` property.
Note that the `PulsarListener` has a subscription type of `Shared`, as the DLQ feature only works with shared subscriptions.
This code is primarily for demonstration purposes, so we provide an `ackTimeout` value of 1 second.
The idea is that the code throws the exception and, if Pulsar does not receive an ack within 1 second, it does a retry.
If that cycle continues ten times (as that is our max redelivery count in the `DeadLetterPolicy`), the Pulsar consumer publishes the messages to the DLQ topic.
We have another `PulsarListener` that listens on the DLQ topic to receive data as it is published to the DLQ topic.

.Special note on DLQ topics when using partitioned topics
****
If the main topic is partitioned, behind the scenes, each partition is treated as a separate topic by Pulsar.
Pulsar appends `partition-<n>`, where `n` stands for the partition number to the main topic name.
The problem is that, if you do not specify a DLQ topic (as opposed to what we did above), Pulsar publishes to a default topic name that has this ``partition-<n>` info in it -- for example: `topic-with-dlp-partition-0-deadLetterPolicySubscription-DLQ`.
The easy way to solve this is to provide a DLQ topic name always.
****

==== Native Error Handling in Spring for Apache Pulsar

As we noted earlier, the DLQ feature in Apache Pulsar works only for shared subscriptions.
What does an application do if it needs to use some similar feature for non-shared subscriptions?
The main reason Pulsar does not support DLQ on exclusive and failover subscriptions is because those subscription types are order-guaranteed.
Allowing redeliveries, DLQ, and so on effectively receives messages out of order.
However, what if an application are okay with that but, more importantly, needs this DLQ feature for non-shared subscriptions?
For that, Spring for Apache Pulsar provides a `PulsarConsumerErrorHandler`, which you can use across any subscription types in Pulsar:  `Exclusive`, `Failover`, `Shared`, or `Key_Shared`.

When you use `PulsarConsumerErrorHandler` from Spring for Apache Pulsar, make sure not to set the ack timeout properties on the listener.

Let us see some details by examining a few code snippets:

====
[source, java]
----
@EnablePulsar
@Configuration
class PulsarConsumerErrorHandlerConfig {

    @Bean
    PulsarConsumerErrorHandler<String> pulsarConsumerErrorHandler(
            PulsarTemplate<String> pulsarTemplate) {
        return new DefaultPulsarConsumerErrorHandler<>(
                new PulsarDeadLetterPublishingRecoverer<>(pulsarTemplate, (c, m) -> "my-foo-dlt"), new FixedBackOff(100, 10));
    }

    @PulsarListener(id = "pulsarConsumerErrorHandler-id", subscriptionName = "pulsatConsumerErrorHandler-subscription",
                    topics = "pulsarConsumerErrorHandler-topic",
					pulsarConsumerErrorHandler = "pulsarConsumerErrorHandler")
    void listen(String msg) {
        throw new RuntimeException("fail " + msg);
    }

    @PulsarListener(id = "pceh-dltListener", topics = "my-foo-dlt")
    void listenDlt(String msg) {
        System.out.println("From DLT: " + msg);
    }

}
----
====

Consider the `pulsarConsumerErrorHandler` bean.
This creates a bean of type `PulsarConsumerErrorHandler` and uses the default implementation provided out of the box by Spring for Apache Pulsar: `DefaultPulsarConsumerErrorHandler`.
`DefaultPulsarConsumerErrorHandler` has a constructor that takes a `PulsarMessageRecovererFactory` and a `org.springframework.util.backoff.Backoff`.
`PulsarMessageRecovererFactory` is a functional interface with the following API:

====
[source, java]
----
@FunctionalInterface
public interface PulsarMessageRecovererFactory<T> {

	/**
	 * Provides a message recoverer {@link PulsarMessageRecoverer}.
	 * @param consumer Pulsar consumer
	 * @return {@link PulsarMessageRecoverer}.
	 */
	PulsarMessageRecoverer<T> recovererForConsumer(Consumer<T> consumer);

}

----
====

The `recovererForConsumer` method takes a Pulsar consumer and returns a `PulsarMessageRecoverer`, which is another functional interface.
Here is the API of `PulsarMessageRecoverer`:

====
[source, java]
----
public interface PulsarMessageRecoverer<T> {

	/**
	 * Recover a failed message, for e.g. send the message to a DLT.
	 * @param message Pulsar message
	 * @param exception exception from failed message
	 */
	void recoverMessage(Message<T> message, Exception exception);

}
----
====

Spring for Apache Pulsar provides an implementation for `PulsarMessageRecovererFactory` called `PulsarDeadLetterPublishingRecoverer` that provides a default implementation that can recover the message by sending it to a Dead Letter Topic (DLT).
We provide this implementation to the constructor for the preceding `DefaultPulsarConsumerErrorHandler`.
As the second argument, we provide a `FixedBackOff`.
You can also provide the `ExponentialBackoff` from Spring for advanced backoff features.
Then we provide this bean name for the `PulsarConsumerErrorHandler` as a property to the `PulsarListener`.
The property is called `pulsarConsumerErrorHandler`.
Each time the `PulsarListener` method fails for a message, it gets retried.
The number of retries are controlled by the `Backoff` provided implementation values. In our example, we do 10 retries (11 total tries -- the first one and then the 10 retries).
Once all the retries are exhausted, the message is sent to the DLT topic.

The `PulsarDeadLetterPublishingRecoverer` implementation we provide uses a `PulsarTemplate` that is used for publishing the message to the DLT.
In most cases, the same auto-configured `PulsarTemplate` from Spring Boot is sufficient with the caveat for partitioned topics.
When using partitioned topics and using custom message routing for the main topic, you must use a different `PulsarTemplate` that does not take the auto-configured `PulsarProducerFactory` that is populated with a value of `custompartition` for `message-routing-mode`.
You can use a `PulsarConsumerErrorHandler` with the following blueprint:

====
[source, java]
----
@Bean
PulsarConsumerErrorHandler<Integer> pulsarConsumerErrorHandler(PulsarClient pulsarClient) {
    PulsarProducerFactory<Integer> pulsarProducerFactory = new DefaultPulsarProducerFactory<>(pulsarClient, Map.of());
        PulsarTemplate<Integer> pulsarTemplate = new PulsarTemplate<>(pulsarProducerFactory);

        BiFunction<Consumer<?>, Message<?>, String> destinationResolver =
                (c, m) -> "my-foo-dlt";

        PulsarDeadLetterPublishingRecoverer<Integer> pulsarDeadLetterPublishingRecoverer =
                new PulsarDeadLetterPublishingRecoverer<>(pulsarTemplate, destinationResolver);

        return new DefaultPulsarConsumerErrorHandler<>(pulsarDeadLetterPublishingRecoverer,
                new FixedBackOff(100, 5));
}
----
====

Note that we are provide a destination resolver to the `PulsarDeadLetterPublishingRecoverer` as the second constructor argument.
If not provided, `PulsarDeadLetterPublishingRecoverer` uses `<subscription-name>-<topic-name>-DLT>` as the DLT topic name.
When using this feature, you should use a proper destination name by setting the destination resolver rather than using the default.

When using a single record message listener, as we did with `PulsarConsumerErrorHnadler`, and if you use manual acknowledgement, make sure to not negatively acknowledge the message when an exception is thrown.
Rather, re-throw the exception back to the container. Otherwise, the container thinks the message is handled separately, and the error handling is not triggered.

Finally, we have a second `PulsarListener` that receives messages from the DLT topic.

In the examples provided in this section so far, we only saw how to use `PulsarConsumerErrorHandler` with a single record message listener.
Next, we look at how you can use this on batch listeners.

==== Batch listener with PulsarConsumerErrorHandler

First, let us look at a batch `PulsarListener` method:

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "batch-demo-5-sub", topics = "batch-demo-4", batch = true, concurrency = "3",
            subscriptionType = SubscriptionType.Failover,
            pulsarConsumerErrorHandler = "pulsarConsumerErrorHandler", ackMode = AckMode.MANUAL)
void listen(List<Message<Integer>> data, Consumer<Integer> consumer, Acknowledgment acknowledgment) {
    for (Message<Integer> datum : data) {
        if (datum.getValue() == 5) {
            throw new PulsarBatchListenerFailedException("failed", datum);
        }
        acknowledgement.acknowledge(datum.getMessageId());
    }
}

@Bean
PulsarConsumerErrorHandler<String> pulsarConsumerErrorHandler(
        PulsarTemplate<String> pulsarTemplate) {
    return new DefaultPulsarConsumerErrorHandler<>(
            new PulsarDeadLetterPublishingRecoverer<>(pulsarTemplate, (c, m) -> "my-foo-dlt"), new FixedBackOff(100, 10));
}

@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "my-dlt-subscription", topics = "my-foo-dlt")
void dltReceiver(Message<Integer> message) {
    System.out.println("DLT - RECEIVED: " + message.getValue());
}

----
====

Once again, we provide the `pulsarConsumerErrorHandler` property with the `PulsarConsumerErrorHandler` bean name.
When you use a batch listener (as shown in the preceding example) and want to use the `PulsarConsumerErrorHandler` from Spring for Apache Pulsar, you need to use manual acknowledgment.
This way, you can acknowledge all the successful individual messages.
For the ones that fail, you must throw a `PulsarBatchListenerFailedException` with the message on which it fails.
Without this exception, the framework does not know what to do with the failure.
On retry, the container sends a new batch of messages, starting with the failed message to the listener.
If it fails again, it is retried, until the retries are exhausted, at which point the message is sent to the DLT.
At that point, the message is acknowledged by the container, and the listener is handed over with the subsequent messages in the original batch.

=== Pausing and Resuming Message Listener Containers

There are situations in which an application might want to pause message consumption temporarily and then resume later.
Spring for Apache Pulsar provides the ability to pause and resume the underlying message listener containers.
When the Pulsar message listener container is paused, any polling done by the container to receive data from the Pulsar consumer will be paused.
Similarly, when the container is resumed, the next poll starts returning data if the topic has any new records added while paused.

To pause or resume a listener container, first obtain the container instance via the `PulsarListenerEndpointRegistry` bean and then invoke the pause/resume API on the container instance - as shown in the snippet below:
====
[source, java]
----
@Autowired
private PulsarListenerEndpointRegistry registry;

void someMethod() {
  PulsarMessageListenerContainer container = registry.getListenerContainer("my-listener-id");
  container.pause();
}
----
====

TIP: The id parameter passed to `getListenerContainer` is the container id - which will be the value of the `@PulsarListener` id attribute when pausing/resuming a `@PulsarListener`.

[[imperative-pulsar-reader]]
=== Pulsar Reader Support
The framework provides support for using {apache-pulsar-docs}/concepts-clients/#reader-interface[Pulsar Reader] via the `PulsarReaderFactory`.

Spring Boot provides this reader factory which can be configured with any of the <<application-properties.adoc#appendix.application-properties.pulsar-reader,`spring.pulsar.reader`>> prefixed application properties.



== Publishing and Consuming Partitioned Topics

In the following example, we publish to a topic called `hello-pulsar-partitioned`.
It is a topic that is partitioned, and, for this sample, we assume that the topic is already created with three partitions.

====
[source, java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class PulsarBootPartitioned {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(PulsarBootPartitioned.class, "--spring.pulsar.producer.message-routing-mode=CustomPartition");
	}

	@Bean
	public ApplicationRunner runner(PulsarTemplate<String> pulsarTemplate) {
		pulsarTemplate.setDefaultTopicName("hello-pulsar-partitioned");
		return args -> {
			for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
				pulsarTemplate.sendAsync("hello john doe 0 ", new FooRouter());
				pulsarTemplate.sendAsync("hello alice doe 1", new BarRouter());
				pulsarTemplate.sendAsync("hello buzz doe 2", new BuzzRouter());
			}
		};
	}

	@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "hello-pulsar-partitioned-subscription", topics = "hello-pulsar-partitioned")
	public void listen(String message) {
		System.out.println("Message Received: " + message);
	}

    static class FooRouter implements MessageRouter {

		@Override
		public int choosePartition(Message<?> msg, TopicMetadata metadata) {
			return 0;
		}
	}

	static class BarRouter implements MessageRouter {

		@Override
		public int choosePartition(Message<?> msg, TopicMetadata metadata) {
			return 1;
		}
	}

	static class BuzzRouter implements MessageRouter {

		@Override
		public int choosePartition(Message<?> msg, TopicMetadata metadata) {
			return 2;
		}
	}

}
----
====

In the preceding example, we publish to a partitioned topic, and we would like to publish some data segment to a specific partition.
If you leave it to Pulsar's default, it follows a round-robin mode of partition assignments, and we would like to override that.
To do so, we provide a message router object with the `send` method.
Consider the three message routers implemented.
`FooRouter` always sends data to partition `0`, `BarRouter` sends to partition `1`, and `BuzzRouter` sends to partition `2`.
Also note that we now use the `sendAsync` method of `PulsarTemplate` that returns a `CompletableFuture`.
When running the application, we also need to set the `messageRoutingMode` on the producer to `CustomPartition` (`spring.pulsar.producer.message-routing-mode`).

On the consumer side, we use a `PulsarListener` with the exclusive subscription type.
This means that data from all the partitions ends up in the same consumer and there is no ordering guarantee.

What can we do if we want each partition to be consumed by a single distinct consumer?
We can switch to the `failover` subscription mode and add three separate consumers:

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "hello-pulsar-partitioned-subscription", topics = "hello-pulsar-partitioned", subscriptionType = SubscriptionType.Failover)
public void listen1(String foo) {
    System.out.println("Message Received 1: " + foo);
}

@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "hello-pulsar-partitioned-subscription", topics = "hello-pulsar-partitioned", subscriptionType = SubscriptionType.Failover)
public void listen2(String foo) {
    System.out.println("Message Received 2: " + foo);
}

@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "hello-pulsar-partitioned-subscription",  topics = "hello-pulsar-partitioned", subscriptionType = SubscriptionType.Failover)
public void listen3(String foo) {
    System.out.println("Message Received 3: " + foo);
}
----
====

When you follow this approach, a single partition always gets consumed by a dedicated consumer.

In a similar vein, if you want to use Pulsar's shared consumer type, you can use the `shared` subscription type.
However, when you use the `shared` mode, you lose any ordering guarantees, as a single consumer may receive messages from all the partitions before another consumer gets a chance.

Consider the following example:

====
[source, java]
----
@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "hello-pulsar-shared-subscription", topics = "hello-pulsar-partitioned", subscriptionType = SubscriptionType.Shared)
public void listen1(String foo) {
    System.out.println("Message Received 1: " + foo);
}

@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "hello-pulsar-shared-subscription", topics = "hello-pulsar-partitioned", subscriptionType = SubscriptionType.Shared)
public void listen2(String foo) {
    System.out.println("Message Received 2: " + foo);
}
----
====
