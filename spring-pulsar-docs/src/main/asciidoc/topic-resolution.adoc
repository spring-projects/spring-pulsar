= Topic Resolution

A destination topic is needed when producing or consuming messages.
The framework looks in the following ordered locations to determine a topic (stopping at the first find):

* User specified
* Message type default
* Global default

When a topic is found via one of the default mechanisms, there is no need to specify the topic on the produce or consume API.

When a topic is not found, the API will throw an exception accordingly.

== User specified
A topic passed into the API being used has the highest precedence (eg. `PulsarTemplate.send("my-topic", myMessage)` or `@PulsarListener(topics = "my-topic"`).

== Message type default
When no topic is passed into the API, the system looks for a message type to topic mapping configured for the type of the message being produced or consumed.

Mappings can be configured with the `spring.pulsar.defaults.type-mappings` property.
The following example uses `application.yml` to configure default topics to use when consuming or producing `Foo` or `Bar` messages:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
spring:
  pulsar:
    defaults:
      type-mappings:
        - message-type: com.acme.Foo
          topic-name: foo-topic
        - message-type: com.acme.Bar
          topic-name: bar-topic
----

NOTE: The `message-type` is the fully-qualified name of the message class.

WARNING: If the message (or the first message of a `Publisher` input) is `null`, the framework won't be able to determine the topic from it. Another method shall be used to specify the topic if your application is likely to send `null` messages.

=== Custom topic resolver
The preferred method of adding mappings is via the property mentioned above.
However, if more control is needed you can replace the default resolver by proving your own implementation, for example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
@Bean
public MyTopicResolver topicResolver() {
	return new MyTopicResolver();
}
----

== Producer global default
The final location consulted (when producing) is the system-wide producer default topic.
It is configured via the `spring.pulsar.producer.topic-name` property when using the imperative API and the `spring.pulsar.reactive.sender.topic-name` property when using the reactive API.

== Consumer global default
The final location consulted (when consuming) is the system-wide consumer default topic.
It is configured via the `spring.pulsar.consumer.topics` or `spring.pulsar.consumer.topics-pattern` property when using the imperative API and one of the `spring.pulsar.reactive.consumer.topics` or `spring.pulsar.reactive.consumer.topics-pattern` property when using the reactive API.
