[[reactive-pulsar]]
= Reactive Support
include::attributes.adoc[]

The framework provides a Reactive counterpart for almost all supported features.

[TIP]
====
If you put the word `Reactive` in front of a provided imperative component, you will likely find its Reactive counterpart.

* `PulsarTemplate -> ReactivePulsarTemplate`
* `PulsarListener -> ReactivePulsarListener`
* `PulsarConsumerFactory -> ReactivePulsarConsumerFactory`
* etc..
====

However, the following is not yet supported:

* Error Handling in non-shared subscriptions
* Accessing Pulsar headers via `@Header` in streaming mode
* Observations

include::reactive-quick-tour.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Design

Here are a few key design points to keep in mind.

=== Apache Pulsar Reactive
The reactive support is ultimately provided by the https://github.com/apache/pulsar-client-reactive[Apache Pulsar Reactive client] whose current implementation is a fully non-blocking adapter around the regular Pulsar client's asynchronous API.
This implies that the Reactive client requires the regular client.

=== Additive Auto-Configuration
Due to the dependence on the regular (imperative) client, the Reactive auto-configuration provided by the framework is additive to the imperative auto-configuration.
In other words, The imperative starter only includes the imperative components but the reactive starter includes both imperative and reactive components.

[[reactive-pulsar-client]]
== Reactive Pulsar Client
When you use the Reactive Pulsar Spring Boot Starter, you get the `ReactivePulsarClient` auto-configured.

By default, the application tries to connect to a local Pulsar instance at `pulsar://localhost:6650`.
This can be adjusted by setting the `spring.pulsar.client.service-url` property to a different value.

TIP: The value must be a valid {apache-pulsar-docs}/client-libraries-java/#connection-urls[Pulsar Protocol] URL

There are many other application properties (inherited from the adapted imperative client) available to configure.
See the <<application-properties.adoc#appendix.application-properties.pulsar-client,Appendix>> for properties prefixed with `spring.pulsar.client`.

[[reactive-client-authentication]]
=== Authentication
To connect to a Pulsar cluster that requires authentication, follow <<pulsar.adoc#client-authentication,the same steps>> as the imperative client.
Again, this is because the reactive client adapts the imperative client which handles all security configuration.

[[reactive-message-production]]
== Message Production

[[reactive-pulsar-template]]
=== ReactivePulsarTemplate
On the Pulsar producer side, Spring Boot auto-configuration provides a `ReactivePulsarTemplate` for publishing records. The template implements an interface called `ReactivePulsarOperations` and provides methods to publish records through its contract.

The template provides send methods that accept a single message and return a `Mono<MessageId>`.
It also provides send methods that accept multiple messages (in the form of the ReactiveStreams `Publisher` type) and return a `Flux<MessageId>`.

NOTE: For the API variants that do not include a topic parameter, a <<topic-resolution.adoc#appendix.topic-resolution,topic resolution process>> is used to determine the destination topic.

==== Fluent API
The template provides a {javadocs}/org/springframework/pulsar/reactive/core/ReactivePulsarOperations.html#newMessage(T)[fluent builder] to handle more complicated send requests.

==== Message customization
You can specify a `MessageSpecBuilderCustomizer` to configure the outgoing message. For example, the following code shows how to send a keyed message:
====
[source, java]
----
template.newMessage(msg)
    .withMessageCustomizer((mc) -> mc.key("foo-msg-key"))
    .send();
----
====

==== Sender customization
You can specify a `ReactiveMessageSenderBuilderCustomizer` to configure the underlying Pulsar sender builder that ultimately constructs the sender used to send the outgoing message.

WARNING: Use with caution as this gives full access to the sender builder and invoking some of its methods (such as `create`) may have unintended side effects.

For example, the following code shows how to disable batching and enable chunking:
====
[source, java]
----
template.newMessage(msg)
    .withSenderCustomizer((sc) -> sc.enableChunking(true).enableBatching(false))
    .send();
----
====

This other example shows how to use custom routing when publishing records to partitioned topics.
Specify your custom `MessageRouter` implementation on the sender builder such as:
====
[source, java]
----
template.newMessage(msg)
    .withSenderCustomizer((sc) -> sc.messageRouter(messageRouter))
    .send();
----
====

TIP: Note that, when using a `MessageRouter`, the only valid setting for `spring.pulsar.reactive.sender.message-routing-mode` is `custom`.

:template-class: ReactivePulsarTemplate
include::schema-info/schema-info-template.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

[[reactive-sender-factory]]
=== ReactivePulsarSenderFactory
The `ReactivePulsarTemplate` relies on a `ReactivePulsarSenderFactory` to actually create the underlying sender.

Spring Boot provides this sender factory which can be configured with any of the <<application-properties.adoc#appendix.application-properties.pulsar-reactive-sender,`spring.pulsar.reactive.sender`>> prefixed application properties.

NOTE: If topic information is not specified when using the sender factory APIs directly, the same <<topic-resolution.adoc#appendix.topic-resolution,topic resolution process>> used by the `ReactivePulsarTemplate` is used with the one exception that the "Message type default" step is **omitted**.

==== Producer Caching
Each underlying Pulsar producer consumes resources.
To improve performance and avoid continual creation of producers, the `ReactiveMessageSenderCache` in the underlying Apache Pulsar Reactive client caches the producers that it creates.
They are cached in an LRU fashion and evicted when they have not been used within a configured time period.

You can configure the cache settings by specifying any of the <<application-properties.adoc#appendix.application-properties.pulsar-reactive-sender,`spring.pulsar.reactive.sender.cache`>> prefixed application properties.

[[reactive-message-consumption]]
== Message Consumption

[[reactive-pulsar-listener]]
=== @ReactivePulsarListener

When it comes to Pulsar consumers, we recommend that end-user applications use the `ReactivePulsarListener` annotation.
To use `ReactivePulsarListener`, you need to use the `@EnableReactivePulsar` annotation.
When you use Spring Boot support, it automatically enables this annotation and configures all necessary components, such as the message listener infrastructure (which is responsible for creating the underlying Pulsar consumer).

Let us revisit the `ReactivePulsarListener` code snippet we saw in the quick-tour section:

====
[source, java]
----
@ReactivePulsarListener(subscriptionName = "hello-pulsar-sub", topics = "hello-pulsar-topic")
Mono<Void> listen(String message) {
    System.out.println(message);
    return Mono.empty();
}
----
====

NOTE: The listener method returns a `Mono<Void>` to signal whether the message was successfully processed. `Mono.empty()` indicates success (acknowledgment) and `Mono.error()` indicates failure (negative acknowledgment).

You can also further simplify this method:
====
[source, java]
----
@ReactivePulsarListener
Mono<Void> listen(String message) {
    System.out.println(message);
    return Mono.empty();
}
----
====

In this most basic form, you must still provide the topic name by setting the following property:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
spring.pulsar.reactive.consumer:
  topic-names: hello-pulsar-topic
----

When `subscription-name` is not provided an auto-generated subscription name will be used.

NOTE: If the topic information is not directly provided, a <<topic-resolution.adoc#appendix.topic-resolution,topic resolution process>> is used to determine the destination topic.


In the `ReactivePulsarListener` method shown earlier, we receive the data as `String`, but we do not specify any schema types.
Internally, the framework relies on Pulsar's schema mechanism to convert the data to the required type.
The framework detects that you expect the `String` type and then infers the schema type based on that information.
Then it provides that schema to the consumer.
For all the primitive types in Java, the framework does this inference.
For any complex types (such as JSON, AVRO, and others), the framework cannot do this inference and the user needs to provide the schema type on the annotation using the `schemaType` property.

This example shows how we can consume complex types from a topic:
====
[source, java]
----
@ReactivePulsarListener(topics = "my-topic-2", schemaType = SchemaType.JSON)
Mono<Void> listen(Foo message) {
    System.out.println(message);
    return Mono.empty();
}
----
====

Note the addition of a `schemaType` property on `ReactivePulsarListener`.
That is because the library is not capable of inferring the schema type from the provided type: `Foo`. We must tell the framework what schema to use.

Let us look at a few more ways we can consume.

This example consumes the Pulsar message directly:
====
[source, java]
----
@ReactivePulsarListener(topics = "my-topic")
Mono<Void> listen(org.apache.pulsar.client.api.Message<String> message) {
    System.out.println(message.getValue());
    return Mono.empty();
}
----
====

This example consumes the record wrapped in a Spring messaging envelope:
====
[source, java]
----
@ReactivePulsarListener(topics = "my-topic")
Mono<Void> listen(org.springframework.messaging.Message<String> message) {
    System.out.println(message.getPayload());
    return Mono.empty();
}
----
====

==== Streaming
All of the above are examples of consuming a single record one-by-one.
However, one of the compelling reasons to use Reactive is for the streaming capability with backpressure support.

The following example uses `ReactivePulsarListener` to consume a stream of POJOs:

====
[source, java]
----
@ReactivePulsarListener(topics = "streaming-1", stream = true)
Flux<MessageResult<Void>> listen(Flux<Message<String>> messages) {
    return messages
        .doOnNext((msg) -> System.out.println("Received: " + msg.getValue()))
        .map(MessageResult::acknowledge);
----
====
Here we receive the records as a `Flux` of messages.
In addition, to enable stream consumption at the `ReactivePulsarListener` level, you need to set the `stream` property on the annotation to `true`.

NOTE: The listener method returns a `Flux<MessageResult<Void>>` where each element represents a processed message and holds the message id, value and whether it was acknowledged. The `MessageResult` has a set of static factory methods that can be used to create the appropriate `MessageResult` instance.

Based on the actual type of the messages in the `Flux`, the framework tries to infer the schema to use.
If it contains a complex type, you still need to provide the `schemaType` on `ReactivePulsarListener`.

The following listener uses the Spring messaging `Message` envelope with a complex type :
====
[source, java]
----
@ReactivePulsarListener(topics = "streaming-2", stream = true, schemaType = SchemaType.JSON)
Flux<MessageResult<Void>> listen2(Flux<org.springframework.messaging.Message<Foo>> messages) {
    return messages
        .doOnNext((msg) -> System.out.println("Received: " + msg.getPayload()))
        .map(MessageResult::acknowledge);
}
----
====

==== Configuration - Application Properties
The listener ultimately relies on `ReactivePulsarConsumerFactory` to create and manage the underlying Pulsar consumer.

Spring Boot provides this consumer factory which can be configured with any of the <<application-properties.adoc#appendix.application-properties.pulsar-reactive-consumer,`spring.pulsar.reactive.consumer`>> prefixed application properties.

[[reactive-consumer-customizer]]
==== Consumer Customization

You can specify a `ReactiveMessageConsumerBuilderCustomizer` to configure the underlying Pulsar consumer builder that ultimately constructs the consumer used by the listener to receive the messages.

WARNING: Use with caution as this gives full access to the consumer builder and invoking some of its methods (such as `create`) may have unintended side effects.

For example, the following code shows how to set the initial position of the subscription to the earliest messaage on the topic.

====
[source, java]
----
@ReactivePulsarListener(topics = "hello-pulsar-topic", consumerCustomizer = "myConsumerCustomizer")
Mono<Void> listen(String message) {
    System.out.println(message);
    return Mono.empty();
}

@Bean
ReactiveMessageConsumerBuilderCustomizer<String> myConsumerCustomizer() {
    return b -> b.subscriptionInitialPosition(SubscriptionInitialPosition.Earliest);
}
----
====

You can also use the customizer to provide direct Pulsar consumer properties to the consumer builder.
This is convenient if you do not want to use the Boot configuration properties mentioned earlier or have multiple `ReactivePulsarListener` methods whose configuration varies.

The following customizer example uses direct Pulsar consumer properties:

====
[source, java]
----
@Bean
ReactiveMessageConsumerBuilderCustomizer<String> directConsumerPropsCustomizer() {
    return b -> b.property("subscriptionName", "subscription-1").property("topicNames", "foo-1");
}
----
====

CAUTION: The properties used are direct Pulsar consumer properties, not the `spring.pulsar.reactive.consumer` Spring Boot configuration properties

include::schema-info/schema-info-listener.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

[[reactive-message-listener-container]]
=== Message Listener Container Infrastructure

In most scenarios, we recommend using the `ReactivePulsarListener` annotation directly for consuming from a Pulsar topic as that model covers a broad set of application use cases.
However, it is important to understand how `ReactivePulsarListener` works internally.

The message listener container is at the heart of message consumption when you use Spring for Apache Pulsar.
The `ReactivePulsarListener` uses the message listener container infrastructure behind the scenes to create and manage the underlying Pulsar consumer.

==== ReactivePulsarMessageListenerContainer
The contract for this message listener container is provided through `ReactivePulsarMessageListenerContainer` whose default implementation creates a reactive Pulsar consumer and wires up a reactive message pipeline that uses the created consumer.

==== ReactiveMessagePipeline
The pipeline is a feature of the underlying Apache Pulsar Reactive client which does the heavy lifting of receiving the data in a reactive manner and then handing it over to the provided message handler. The reactive message listener container implementation is much simpler because the pipeline handles the majority of the work.

==== ReactivePulsarMessageHandler
The "listener" aspect is provided by the `ReactivePulsarMessageHandler` of which there are two provided implementations:

* `ReactivePulsarOneByOneMessageHandler` - handles a single message one-by-one
* `ReactivePulsarStreamingHandler` - handles multiple messages via a `Flux`

NOTE: If topic information is not specified when using the listener containers directly, the same <<topic-resolution.adoc#appendix.topic-resolution,topic resolution process>> used by the `ReactivePulsarListener` is used with the one exception that the "Message type default" step is **omitted**.

[[reactive-concurrency]]
=== Concurrency
When consuming records in streaming mode (`stream = true`) concurrency comes naturally via the underlying Reactive support in the client implementation.

However, when handling messages one-by-one, concurrency can be specified to increase processing throughput.
Simply set the `concurrency` property on `@ReactivePulsarListener`.
Additionally, when `concurrency > 1` you can ensure messages are ordered by key and therefore sent to the same handler by setting `useKeyOrderedProcessing = "true"` on the annotation.

Again, the `ReactiveMessagePipeline` does the heavy lifting, we simply set the properties on it.

.[small]#Reactive vs Imperative#
****
Concurrency in the reactive container is different from its imperative counterpart.
The latter creates multiple threads (each with a Pulsar consumer) whereas the former dispatches the messages to multiple handler instances concurrently on the Reactive parallel scheduler.

One advantage of reactive concurrency is that it can be used with `Exclusive` and `Failover` subscriptions to increase processing throughput if strict ordering is not required.
In contrast to imperative concurrency that can not currently be used with `Exclusive` and does not provide more processing power with `Failover`.
****

[[reactive-pulsar-headers]]
=== Pulsar Headers
The Pulsar message metadata can be consumed as Spring message headers.
The list of available headers can be found in https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-pulsar/blob/main/spring-pulsar/src/main/java/org/springframework/pulsar/support/PulsarHeaders.java[PulsarHeaders.java].

==== Accessing In OneByOne Listener
The following example shows how you can access Pulsar Headers when using a one-by-one message listener:

====
[source,java]
----
@ReactivePulsarListener(topics = "some-topic")
Mono<Void> listen(String data,
        @Header(PulsarHeaders.MESSAGE_ID) MessageId messageId,
        @Header("foo") String foo) {
    System.out.println("Received " + data + " w/ id=" + messageId + " w/ foo=" + foo);
    return Mono.empty();
}
----
====

In the preceding example, we access the values for the `messageId` message metadata as well as a custom message property named `foo`.
The Spring `@Header` annotation is used for each header field.

You can also use Pulsar's `Message` as the envelope to carry the payload.
When doing so, the user can directly call the corresponding methods on the Pulsar message for retrieving the metadata.
However, as a convenience, you can also retrieve it by using the `Header` annotation.
Note that you can also use the Spring messaging `Message` envelope to carry the payload and then retrieve the Pulsar headers by using `@Header`.

==== Accessing In Streaming Listener
When using a streaming message listener the header support is limited.
Only when the `Flux` contains Spring `org.springframework.messaging.Message` elements will the headers be populated.
Additionally, the Spring `@Header` annotation can not be used to retrieve the data.
You must directly call the corresponding methods on the Spring message to retrieve the data.


[[reactive-message-ack]]
=== Message Acknowledgment
The framework automatically handles message acknowledgement.
However, the listener method must send a signal indicating whether the message was successfully processed.
The container implementation then uses that signal to perform the ack or nack operation.
This is a slightly different from its imperative counterpart where the signal is implied as positive unless the method throws an exception.

==== OneByOne Listener
The single message (aka OneByOne) message listener method returns a `Mono<Void>` to signal whether the message was successfully processed. `Mono.empty()` indicates success (acknowledgment) and `Mono.error()` indicates failure (negative acknowledgment).

==== Streaming Listener
The streaming listener method returns a `Flux<MessageResult<Void>>` where each `MessageResult` element represents a processed message and holds the message id, value and whether it was acknowledged. The `MessageResult` has a set of `acknowledge` and `negativeAcknowledge` static factory methods that can be used to create the appropriate `MessageResult` instance.

[[reactive-redelivery]]
=== Message Redelivery and Error Handling
Apache Pulsar provides various native strategies for message redelivery and error handling.
We will take a look at them and see how to use them through Spring for Apache Pulsar.

==== Acknowledgment Timeout
By default, Pulsar consumers do not redeliver messages unless the consumer crashes, but you can change this behavior by setting an ack timeout on the Pulsar consumer.
When you use Spring for Apache Pulsar, you can enable this property by setting the `spring.pulsar.reactive.consumer.ack-timeout` Boot property.
If this property has a value above zero and if the Pulsar consumer does not acknowledge a message within that timeout period, the message is redelivered.

You can also specify this property directly as a Pulsar consumer property via a <<reactive-consumer-customizer,consumer customizer>> such as:

====
[source, java]
----
@Bean
ReactiveMessageConsumerBuilderCustomizer<String> consumerCustomizer() {
    return b -> b.property("ackTimeout", "60s");
}
----
====

==== Negative Acknowledgment Redelivery Delay
When acknowledging negatively, Pulsar consumer lets you specify how the application wants the message to be re-delivered.
The default is to redeliver the message in one minute, but you can change it by setting `spring.pulsar.reactive.consumer.negative-ack-redelivery-delay`.

You can also set it directly as a Pulsar consumer property via a <<reactive-consumer-customizer,consumer customizer>> such as:

====
[source, java]
----
@Bean
ReactiveMessageConsumerBuilderCustomizer<String> consumerCustomizer() {
    return b -> b.property("negativeAckRedeliveryDelay", "10ms");
}
----
====

==== Dead Letter Topic
Apache Pulsar lets applications use a dead letter topic on consumers with a `Shared` subscription type.
For the `Exclusive` and `Failover` subscription types, this feature is not available.
The basic idea is that, if a message is retried a certain number of times (maybe due to an ack timeout or nack redelivery), once the number of retries are exhausted, the message can be sent to a special topic called the dead letter queue (DLQ).
Let us see some details around this feature in action by inspecting some code snippets:

====
[source, java]
----
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
class DeadLetterPolicyConfig {

    @ReactivePulsarListener(
            topics = "topic-with-dlp",
            subscriptionType = SubscriptionType.Shared,
            deadLetterPolicy = "myDeadLetterPolicy",
            consumerCustomizer = "ackTimeoutCustomizer" )
    void listen(String msg) {
        throw new RuntimeException("fail " + msg);
    }

    @ReactivePulsarListener(topics = "my-dlq-topic")
    void listenDlq(String msg) {
        System.out.println("From DLQ: " + msg);
    }

    @Bean
    DeadLetterPolicy myDeadLetterPolicy() {
        return DeadLetterPolicy.builder().maxRedeliverCount(10).deadLetterTopic("my-dlq-topic").build();
    }

    @Bean
    ReactiveMessageConsumerBuilderCustomizer<String> ackTimeoutCustomizer() {
        return b -> b.property("ackTimeout", "1s");
    }
}
----
====

First, we have a special bean for `DeadLetterPolicy`, and it is named as `deadLetterPolicy` (it can be any name as you wish).
This bean specifies a number of things, such as the max delivery (10, in this case) and the name of the dead letter topic -- `my-dlq-topic`, in this case.
If you do not specify a DLQ topic name, it defaults to `<topicname>-<subscriptionname>-DLQ` in Pulsar.
Next, we provide this bean name to `ReactivePulsarListener` by setting the `deadLetterPolicy` property.
Note that the `ReactivePulsarListener` has a subscription type of `Shared`, as the DLQ feature only works with shared subscriptions.
This code is primarily for demonstration purposes, so we provide an `ackTimeout` value of 1 second.
The idea is that the code throws the exception and, if Pulsar does not receive an ack within 1 second, it does a retry.
If that cycle continues ten times (as that is our max redelivery count in the `DeadLetterPolicy`), the Pulsar consumer publishes the messages to the DLQ topic.
We have another `ReactivePulsarListener` that listens on the DLQ topic to receive data as it is published to the DLQ topic.

.Special note on DLQ topics when using partitioned topics
****
If the main topic is partitioned, behind the scenes, each partition is treated as a separate topic by Pulsar.
Pulsar appends `partition-<n>`, where `n` stands for the partition number to the main topic name.
The problem is that, if you do not specify a DLQ topic (as opposed to what we did above), Pulsar publishes to a default topic name that has this ``partition-<n>` info in it -- for example: `topic-with-dlp-partition-0-deadLetterPolicySubscription-DLQ`.
The easy way to solve this is to provide a DLQ topic name always.
****

[[reactive-pulsar-reader]]
=== Pulsar Reader Support
The framework provides support for using {apache-pulsar-docs}/concepts-clients/#reader-interface[Pulsar Reader] in a Reactive fashion via the `ReactivePulsarReaderFactory`.

Spring Boot provides this reader factory which can be configured with any of the <<application-properties.adoc#appendix.application-properties.pulsar-reactive-reader,`spring.pulsar.reactive.reader`>> prefixed application properties.
