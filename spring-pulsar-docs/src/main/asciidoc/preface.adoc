This project provides a basic Spring-friendly API for developing https://pulsar.apache.org/[Apache Pulsar] applications.

On a very high-level, Spring for Apache Pulsar provides a `PulsarTemplate` for publishing to a Pulsar topic and a `PulsarListener` annotation for consuming from it.
In addition, it also provides various convenient APIs for Spring developers to ramp up their development journey into Aapche Pulsar.
