=== Quick Tour

In this section, we will take a quick tour of Spring for Apache Pulsar.

==== Minimum Supported Versions

The minimum supported versions for the underlying libraries required by the framework are as follows:
|===
| Library | Version

| Java
| 17

| Apache Pulsar
| 2.10.0

| Spring Boot
| 3.0.0

| Spring Framework
| 6.0.0

| Gradle
| 7.x (7.5 or later)
|===

=== Building the Project

Spring for Apache Pulsar uses Gradle as it's build tool. Run the following command to do a full build of the project.
[indent=0]
----
./gradlew clean build
----
You can build without running tests by using the following command:
[indent=0]
----
./gradlew clean build -x test
----

=== Quick Sample

In the following sample Spring Boot application, we show how to write a publisher and consumer using Spring for Apache Pulsar.
This is a complete application and does not require any additional configuration as long as you have Pulsar cluster running on the default location - `localhost:6650`.

NOTE: We recommend the usage of a Spring-Boot-First-Approach for Spring for Apache Pulsar based application as that simplifies things tremendously. To encourage this, a `spring-pulsar-spring-boot-starter` module is published that can easily be consumed by an application as a dependency.

@SpringBootApplication
public class PulsarBootHelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(PulsarBootHelloWorld.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    ApplicationRunner runner(PulsarTemplate<String> pulsarTemplate) {
        return (args) -> pulsarTemplate.send("hello-pulsar", "Hello Pulsar World!");
    }

    @PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "hello-pulsar-subscription", topics = "hello-pulsar")
    void listen(String message) {
        System.out.println("Message Received: " + message);
    }
}

Let us go through the higher-level details of this application quickly.
Later on in this documentation, we will see these components in much more detail.

In the sample above, we are heavily relying on Spring Boot auto-configuration.
Spring Boot auto-configures several components for our application.
It automatically provides a `PulsarClient` for the application which is used by both the producer and the consumer.

`PulsarTemplate` also is auto-configured by Spring Boot which we inject in the application and start sending records to a Pulsar topic.
The application sends messages to a topic named `hello-pulsar`.
Note that the application does not specify any schema information.
That is because Spring for Apache Pulsar library automatically infers the schema type from the type of the data that you are sending.

We use `PulsarListener` annotation to consume from the `hello-pulsar` topic where we publish the data.
`PulsarListener` is a convenient annotation that wraps the message listener container infrastructure in Spring for Apache Pulsar.
Behind the scenes, it creates a message listener container which creates and manages the Pulsar consumer.
As with a regular Pulsar consumer, the default subscription type when using `PulsarListener` is the `Exclusive` mode.
As records are published in to the `hello-pulsar` topic, the `Pulsarlistener` consumes them and prints them on the console.
Here also, the framework infers the schema type used from the data type that the `PulsarListner` method uses as the payload - `String` in this case.
