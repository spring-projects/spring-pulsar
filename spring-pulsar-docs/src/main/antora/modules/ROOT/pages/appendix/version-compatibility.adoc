= Pulsar Clients and Spring Boot Compatibility

include::../attributes/attributes.adoc[]

The following is the compatibility matrix:
|===
| Spring for Apache Pulsar | Pulsar Client | Pulsar Reactive Client | Spring Boot | Java

| 1.0.x
| 3.0.x
| 0.3.x
| 3.2.x
| 17+

| 0.2.x
| 2.11.x
| 0.2.x
| 3.0.x / 3.1.x^**(*)**^
| 17+
|===

[NOTE]
====
In version `1.0.0` the autoconfiguration moved into Spring Boot `3.2.x` and therefore `3.2.x` is the minimum Spring Boot version supported when using version `1.0.x` of the framework.

However, prior to version `1.0.0`, the autoconfiguration support exists in the framework itself.
^**(*)**^This makes it theoretically possible to use later versions of Spring Boot besides `3.0.x` which it is tested against and guaranteed to work with. In other words, it may work with `3.1.x` but it has not been tested against it.
