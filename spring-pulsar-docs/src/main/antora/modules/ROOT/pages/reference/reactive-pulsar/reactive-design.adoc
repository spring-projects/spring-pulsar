Here are a few key design points to keep in mind.

== Apache Pulsar Reactive
The reactive support is ultimately provided by the https://github.com/apache/pulsar-client-reactive[Apache Pulsar Reactive client] whose current implementation is a fully non-blocking adapter around the regular Pulsar client's asynchronous API.
This implies that the Reactive client requires the regular client.

== Additive Auto-Configuration
Due to the dependence on the regular (imperative) client, the Reactive auto-configuration provided by the framework is additive to the imperative auto-configuration.
In other words, The imperative starter only includes the imperative components but the reactive starter includes both imperative and reactive components.
