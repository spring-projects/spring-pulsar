=== Pulsar Headers
Pulsar does not have a first-class "`header`" concept but instead provides a map for custom user properties as well as methods to access the message metadata typically stored in a message header (eg. `id` and `event-time`).
As such, the terms "`Pulsar message header`" and "`Pulsar message metadata`" are used interchangeably.
The list of available message metadata (headers) can be found in {github}/blob/main/spring-pulsar/src/main/java/org/springframework/pulsar/support/PulsarHeaders.java[PulsarHeaders.java].

=== Spring Headers
Spring Messaging provides first-class "`header`" support via its `MessageHeaders` abstraction.

=== Message Header Mapping
The `PulsarHeaderMapper` strategy is provided to map headers to and from Pulsar user properties and Spring `MessageHeaders`.

Its interface definition is as follows:
[source, java]
----
public interface PulsarHeaderMapper {

	Map<String, String> toPulsarHeaders(MessageHeaders springHeaders);

	MessageHeaders toSpringHeaders(Message<?> pulsarMessage);
}
----

The framework provides a couple of mapper implementations.

- The `JsonPulsarHeaderMapper` maps headers as JSON in order to support rich header types and is the default when the Jackson JSON library is on the classpath.

- The `ToStringPulsarHeaderMapper` maps headers as strings using the `toString()` method on the header values and is the fallback mapper.

==== JSON Header Mapper
The `JsonPulsarHeaderMapper` uses a "`special`" header (with a key of `spring_json_header_types`) that contains a JSON map of `<key>:<type>`.
This header is used on the inbound side (Pulsar -> Spring) to provide appropriate conversion of each header value to the original type.

===== Trusted Packages
By default, the JSON mapper deserializes classes in all packages.
However, if you receive messages from untrusted sources, you may wish to add only those packages you trust via the `trustedPackages` property on a custom configured `JsonPulsarHeaderMapper` bean you provide.

===== ToString Classes
Certain types are not suitable for JSON serialization, and a simple `toString()` serialization might be preferred for these types.
The `JsonPulsarHeaderMapper` has a property called `addToStringClasses()` that lets you supply the names of classes that should be treated this way for outbound mapping.
During inbound mapping, they are mapped as `String`.
By default, only `org.springframework.util.MimeType` and `org.springframework.http.MediaType` are mapped this way.

=== Inbound/Outbound Patterns
On the inbound side, by default, all Pulsar headers (message metadata plus user properties) are mapped to `MessageHeaders`.
On the outbound side, by default, all `MessageHeaders` are mapped, except `id`, `timestamp`, and the headers that represent the Pulsar message metadata.
You can specify which headers are mapped for inbound and outbound messages by configuring the `inboundPatterns` and `outboundPatterns` on a mapper bean you provide.

Patterns are rather simple and can contain a leading wildcard (`\*`), a trailing wildcard, or both (for example, `*.cat.*`).
You can negate patterns with a leading `!`.
The first pattern that matches a header name (whether positive or negative) wins.

IMPORTANT: When you provide your own patterns, we recommend including `!id` and `!timestamp`, since these headers are read-only on the inbound side.
