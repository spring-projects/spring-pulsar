= Spring Pulsar Sample Applications

Sample applications that can be used to demonstrate and manually verify Spring Pulsar functionality.


[[build-apps]]
== Building
To build the applications simply execute the following command from the `spring-pulsar-sample-apps` directory:
[source,bash]
----
../gradlew clean build
----

[[run-apps]]
== Running

=== Pre-requisites
****
* The components have all been built by following the <<build-apps>> steps.
* Apache Pulsar standalone cluster  available at `pulsar://localhost:6650`

TIP: The included link:../tools/pulsar/docker/README.adoc#_start_pulsar[Pulsar tools] can be used to easily start a standalone cluster locally on the required coordinates
****

=== Steps

Make sure the above pre-requisites are satisfied.

===== IDE
To run the app in your IDE just choose `Run/Debug` on the desired sample application class.

===== Command Line
To run the app on the command line open a terminal and navigate to the desired sample application directory (underneath `spring-pulsar-sample-apps`) and execute the following command:

[source,bash]
----
../../gradlew bootRun
----

TIP: When running on the command line the `add-opens` JVM args are automatically configured which prevents annoying exceptions at runtime.
