= Spring for Apache Pulsar
:docs: https://docs.spring.io/spring-pulsar/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference
:github: https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-pulsar

Spring Pulsar provides a basic Spring-friendly API for developing https://pulsar.apache.org/[Apache Pulsar] applications.

**#TIP#**: Most of the ideas in this project are borrowed from the Spring for Apache Kafka project, thus a familiarity with it would help.

== Getting Started
The {docs}/html/[reference documentation] includes a {docs}/html/#quick-tourhtml[quick tour] section.

== Getting Help
Are you having trouble with Spring Pulsar? We want to help!

* Check the {docs}/html/[reference documentation]
* Learn the Spring basics -- Spring Pulsar builds on many other Spring projects; check the https://spring.io[spring.io] website for a wealth of reference documentation.
If you are new to Spring, try one of the https://spring.io/guides[guides].
// TODO (NYI): * If you are upgrading, read the {github}/wiki[release notes] for upgrade instructions and "new and noteworthy" features.
* Ask a question -- we monitor https://stackoverflow.com[stackoverflow.com] for questions tagged with https://stackoverflow.com/tags/spring-pulsar[`spring-pulsar`].
* Report bugs with Spring Pulsar at {github}/issues[github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-pulsar/issues].



== Reporting Issues
Spring Pulsar uses GitHub's integrated issue tracking system to record bugs and feature requests.
If you want to raise an issue, please follow the recommendations below:

* Before you log a bug, please search the {github}/issues[issue tracker] to see if someone has already reported the problem.
* If the issue doesn't already exist, {github}/issues/new[create a new issue].
* Please provide as much information as possible with the issue report.
We like to know the Spring Pulsar version, operating system, and JVM version you're using.
* If you need to paste code or include a stack trace, use Markdown +++```+++ escapes before and after your text.
* If possible, try to create a test case or project that replicates the problem and attach it to the issue.



== Building from Source
You don't need to build from source to use Spring Pulsar (binaries in https://repo.spring.io[repo.spring.io]), but if you want to try out the latest and greatest, Spring Pulsar can be built and published to your local Maven cache using the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html[Gradle wrapper].
You also need JDK 17.

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
----

This will build all jars and documentation and publish them to your local Maven cache.
It won't run any of the tests.
If you want to build everything and run tests, use the `build` task:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew clean build
----

This will build everything and run all tests except the `PulsarFunctionAdministrationIntegrationTests` which requires the _Pulsar RabbitMQ Connector_ to be downloaded prior to running.
To download the connector (one time only) and run the integration test, add a system property to the task as follows:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew clean build -DdownloadRabbitConnector=true
----


== Modules
There are several modules in Spring Pulsar. Here is a quick overview:

=== spring-pulsar
The main library that provides the API to access Apache Pulsar.

=== spring-pulsar-reactive
Provides the API to access Apache Pulsar using a Reactive client.

=== spring-pulsar-dependencies
Provides a Gradle https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_platform_plugin.html[java-platform] that recommends dependency versions.

=== spring-pulsar-docs
Provides reference docs and handles aggregating javadocs.

=== spring-pulsar-spring-boot-autoconfigure
Provides Spring Boot auto-configuration for Spring Pulsar.

=== spring-pulsar-spring-boot-starter
Provides a dependency descriptor that can be included in your application to easily start using Spring Pulsar in an imperative fashion.

=== spring-pulsar-reactive-spring-boot-starter
Provides a dependency descriptor that can be included in your application to easily start using Spring Pulsar in Reactive and imperative fashions.

=== spring-pulsar-spring-cloud-stream-binder
Provides a Spring Cloud Stream Binder implementation for Apache Pulsar.

=== spring-pulsar-sample-apps
Provides sample applications to illustrate Spring Pulsar functionality as well as provide ability for quick manual verification during development.
